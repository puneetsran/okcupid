(update; it is much easier to keep up with email now that it is in my phone.)  i was raised atheist by scientists and now i go to church sometimes. i am dichotomous. i have been called little miss kick ass, and if there is one reason why i'm still single, i think it's probably summed up best by my chinese horoscope -- fire dragon.\", 'religion'] =  'christianity but not too serious about it'"
