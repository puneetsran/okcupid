    "ok_cupid_df.loc[ok_cupid_df['essay1'] == \"i live in the beautiful san francisco bay area, california. i'm currently into my second year of an originally 6 month tour of mexico, which i've extended indefinitely. i keep saying i'm going back soon, cuz i gotta keep a foot planted in the bay. eventually, i want to split my time between both places.  i gotta say, i've fallen head over heels with mexico. just last year, i was kidnapped at gunpoint in mexico city by the midget faction of an obscure drug cartel called los gigantes whose plan was to extort uncle sam for big bucks in exchange for my release. if the government refused to pay, the midgets would chop off my head. i was forced to sit in a windowless room for thirteen days with nothing to do but watch telenovelas through a feverish delirium brought on by a diet of swine flu laden street tacos (i'm sure this can't be kosher). by day fourteen the cartel finally realized that the $7 price of feeding me for two weeks was costlier than holding a brown american for ransom. i was worth about as much as the amero would be at a conspiracy theory convention. so they let me go.  ok, i made that up. but why is it that everyone in the states keeps telling me that that's gonna happen?  anyway, i completed a six month spanish language program at a funky art school in san miguel de allende, and now i've got projects that keep me busy but i also do a lot of chillin'.  i wear many hats and have multiple passions. i'm deeply involved with social, environmental, & food justice. i have a deep passion for gender equity, and i am an unabashed fan, supporter, cheerleader, lover, guerrilla fighter and all around badass for women...which means giving up my bullshit, stepping up, and playing big. the macho crap's played out, fellas.  i love working with my hands. i own a business designing and growing organic veggie gardens and have taught urban veggie gardening in bay area schools.  i used to be the quintessential bay area workshop junkie, and now i love coming up with my own and teaching them - such as japanese cooking, permaculture gardening & massage courses. i've done media and communications strategizing and consulting for grassroots organizations and non-profits developing pressure campaigns to take on big, bad corporations and politicians doing shitty things in the world. love it!! modern day david & goliath work. feels amazing to do an honest day's work by sticking your thumb in the eye of an evil corporation and getting paid for it!  i love to cook & i especially love to cook for friends. i show love by sharing food. food brings us together. it's the foundation of life.  update: i've been creating pop-up restaurants in san miguel. i can't believe how much fun i'm having. i get to mix my pleasure of entertaining guests, cooking and making a little money. what i've done thus far: vietnamese, indian, japanese, mexican, middle eastern/mediterranean. next on my list: ethiopian (but i'm a little intimidated to make it).  i am a lover of the senses. i am a massage therapist and bodyworker. i believe that the pathway to divinity is through the body. touch is my passion. it builds more empathy and connection with our fellow human beings.  i spent the first four months in mexico teaching organic veggie gardening & permaculture to elementary and middle school aged kids at a montessori school here in san miguel. i developed and taught a delicious, natural foods cooking course here. mmmm....que rico! i co-produced my second tedx conference here in san miguel. check it: http://tedxsanmigueldeallende.com/en/  currently, i'm building out a rooftop veggie & flower garden and bedroom for my friend and teaching a workshop on eco-architectural design. update: built, planted and growing.  here's something crazy about mexico. most middle-class educated folks here make about $4,000 pesos a month, which is a little less than $400 u.s. dollars. an a**hole gringo on a tourist visa can roll into town and make $500 pesos per hour doing massage, which is around $45 dollars. which is exactly what i did.  i live in a resort town, and demand for good massage is high. the problem is, is that the local mexican massage therapists generally aren't trained well and are paid low wages. so, a gringo like me comes along and takes their job. the spas love this set-up, because they mostly cater to english speaking clientele, while the therapists are left with no power, no real skills, and are easily replaceable.  so, i decided to start a massage program where local mexican women can learn advanced level bodywork, high-end luxury spa techniques, make great cash, and be so good at what they do that they can roll into any resort city in the world and be the a**hole taking someone else's job.\", 'diet'] = 'mostly vegetarian'\n",

(update; it is much easier to keep up with email now that it is in my phone.)  i was raised atheist by scientists and now i go to church sometimes. i am dichotomous. i have been called little miss kick ass, and if there is one reason why i'm still single, i think it's probably summed up best by my chinese horoscope -- fire dragon.\", 'religion'] =  'christianity but not too serious about it'"
